# vue-mvvm

A lightweight set of MVVM utilities for Vue 3 that helps you structure apps with typed ViewModels, reusable
UserControls, a tiny DI container, and simple router helpers.

> **Note:** That `vue-mvvm` is in early stage development. So not all features might run stable

## ✨ Features

- Typed ViewModel pattern built on the Vue 3 Composition API
- Reusable UserControls for encapsulated UI + logic
- Simple dependency injection (DI) helpers
- Optional router helpers that work with vue-router
- Fully typed, TypeScript-first API
- Small surface area and easy to adopt incrementally

## 📦 Installation

```shell
npm install vue-mvvm
```

## 🧩 Example
